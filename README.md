[✰] 𝘼𝙗𝙤𝙪𝙩 𝙢𝙚;  

- Just Sae.  
- Polyglot. I mainly speak English, but I prefer to be silent.  
- I observe more than I interact.   
- I don’t share much. Either you get it, or you don’t.

📄🌸 - Some doors weren’t meant to be opened. *Curiosity killed the Kat.*

❤️🎵 - Some *love songs* should only be *heard in the quiet between us*, not sung to a world that doesn't understand the melody.

🧪🏫 - *Class 2-5* doesn’t look the same anymore... not since the *outbreak* turned the *hallways into a battlefield*.

🦑🎮 - In a game where the stakes are life, *fairness was never an option.*

🔪🩸 - She doesn’t need an invite. Nanno’s already *seated in the back of your class*, waiting to *expose your darkest secret.*

🌑🔪 - After the sun sets, the whispers begin. It’s your turn to guess… or be guessed.

⚪🎮 - The game has begun. The gods’ eyes are upon you, and there’s no turning back now.

[✖] 𝘿𝙉𝙄;  

- The usual trash: racists, pedos, sexists, homophobes, pro/comp/darkshippers.  
- If you can’t show basic respect, don’t bother.  
- Trolling isn't a personality. Keep moving.  

————————————————————  

[!] 𝙉𝙤𝙩𝙚𝙨;  

- **Don’t copy me OR take inspo off of my skins.** Be original.  
- If I’m quiet, I’m either thinking or just not interested.
