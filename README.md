- Just Sae.  
- Polyglot. I mainly speak English, but I prefer to be silent.  
- I observe more than I interact.  
- Fandoms? A few favorites. You figure them out.  
- I don’t share much. Either you get it, or you don’t.

- The usual trash: racists, pedos, sexists, homophobes, pro&darkshippers.  
- If you can’t show basic respect, don’t bother.  
- Trolling isn't a personality. Keep moving.

[!] 𝙉𝙤𝙩𝙚𝙨;  

- **Don’t copy me OR take inspo off of my skins.** Be original.  
- If I’m quiet, I’m either thinking or just not interested.  
- I don’t owe anyone an explanation.
